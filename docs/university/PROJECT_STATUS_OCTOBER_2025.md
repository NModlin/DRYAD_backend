## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Level 6: Agentic University System (NEW)
- **University Instance Manager** - Create/manage instances
- **Curriculum Engine** - Learning paths & progression
- **Arena/Dojo Framework** - Competitions & tournaments
- **Training Data Pipeline** - Collection to Lyceum

### Levels 0-5: DRYAD Core (EXISTING)
- Level 0: Foundation services
- Level 1: Execution & Memory
- Level 2: Stateful Operations
- Level 3: Orchestration
- Level 4: Evaluation (Dojo)
- Level 5: Self-Improvement (Lyceum)

---

## 🎯 Key Findings

### ✅ DRYAD Has All Building Blocks
- All foundation components exist
- All integration points identified
- All data flows mapped
- Ready for Level 6 abstraction

### ⚠️ Missing: University Abstraction
- No multi-university support
- No curriculum system
- No competition framework
- No training data pipeline

### 💡 Solution: Level 6 Design
- Layered on top of Levels 0-5
- Clean separation of concerns
- Minimal disruption to existing code
- Maximum reuse of existing components
