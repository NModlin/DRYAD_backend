# DRYAD Grove IDE - Development Prompt for Coding Agent

## 🎯 Project Overview
You are tasked with building the **DRYAD Grove IDE**, a comprehensive integrated development environment that serves as the central hub for governed agentic development (GAD) within the DRYAD ecosystem. This IDE will be the primary workspace where developers create, manage, and orchestrate multi-agent development projects using the established Grove → Branch → Vessel hierarchy.

## 🌲 Ecosystem Context & Branding
The DRYAD Grove IDE integrates with your existing ecosystem:

### Established Metaphor Hierarchy:
- **Grove** = Central development environment and project container
- **Branch** = Individual features, code paths, and development tasks
- **Vessel** = Completed deliverables, outputs, and knowledge artifacts
- **Forest Keeper** = Master orchestrator agent (Layer 3 in GAD hierarchy)
- **Guardian** = Quality review and security agent (Layer 2)
- **Branch Weaver** = Code execution agent (Layer 1)
- **Human Provost** = Final oversight and approval (Layer 4)

### Existing Integration Points:
- ROO-Forge system for GAD mode orchestration
- DRYAD University System for agent training and curriculum
- Tool Registry for dynamic capability management
- Knowledge Trees for project persistence and context
- Multi-agent dialogue system for collaboration

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Requirements

### Core IDE Features:
1. **Project Grove Management**
   - Create, open, and manage development groves (projects)
   - Branch management with visual tree representation
   - Vessel storage for deliverables and knowledge artifacts
   - Multi-tenant isolation with client separation

2. **GAD Agent Integration**
   - Visual agent hierarchy display (4-layer GAD system)
   - Agent orchestration interface with Forest Keeper as central coordinator
   - Real-time agent collaboration through dialogue system
   - Guardian quality gate visualization and approval workflows

3. **Knowledge Tree Integration**
   - Persistent project state in groves/branches/vessels
   - Context inheritance and learning persistence
   - Oracle consultation interface for AI guidance
   - University curriculum integration for agent training

4. **Tool Registry Integration**
   - Dynamic tool discovery and validation
   - Custom tool creation through Agent Factory
   - Permission-based tool access control
   - Sandbox management for secure tool execution

### Technical Stack Requirements:
- **Frontend**: Modern web framework (React/Vue/Angular) with real-time updates
- **Backend**: FastAPI/Flask with DRYAD ecosystem integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with DRYAD models (Grove, Branch, Vessel, etc.)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket support for agent communication
- **Authentication**: DRYAD's multi-tenant security model
- **Container Support**: Docker integration for sandboxed execution

### Key Development Principles:
1. **GAD Hierarchy Compliance**: All features must support the 4-layer GAD system
2. **DRYAD Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ecosystem components
3. **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple clients with proper isolation
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Live agent coordination and communication
5. **Knowledge Persistence**: All work must be stored in knowledge trees
6. **Quality Gates**: Guardian review integration throughout development workflow
